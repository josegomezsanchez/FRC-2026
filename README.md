# FRC-2026
This repository has a python script to run optimization/simulation of the rebuilt game.
The optimization software has different robots with strenghts/weaknesses and the goal is to determine
what is the optimal features combination.
🟦 ROLE 0 — Hopper
Core identity: High capacity, high throughput cycler
This robot is designed to collect a lot of Fuel and score it itself. It’s the classic “vacuum + shooter” robot.
Typical traits in the simulation
•	Very high center collection rate
•	Large max capacity (40–70 balls)
•	Prefers large cycles (cycle_size_preference ~0.8–1.0)
•	Uses center→bump→score or center→side→score paths
•	High shooting rate
•	High accuracy
•	Low defend aggressiveness
Strategic purpose
•	Main scoring engine
•	Best for raw Teleop throughput
•	Most sensitive to congestion in the center

🟩 ROLE 1 — Feeder
Core identity: Support robot that collects and delivers Fuel
This robot is meant to reduce congestion and support other scorers.
Typical traits
•	High collection rate (center or wing)
•	Large capacity
•	Medium or high shooting rate
•	Often avoids defended zones
•	Low defend aggressiveness
•	Often uses wing→side→score path
Strategic purpose
•	Reduce center congestion
•	Provide Fuel to shooters
•	Score when not feeding
•	Complement hopper robots

🟧 ROLE 2 — Shooter
Core identity: Fast cycle scoring specialist
This robot focuses on quick cycles, not huge capacity.
Typical traits
•	Medium cycle size
•	Very fast travel times
•	High accuracy
•	High shooting rate
•	Often uses center→side→score path
•	Low defend aggressiveness
Strategic purpose
•	Score frequently with small cycles
•	Avoid congestion by using side lanes
•	Provide consistent scoring even when center is contested

🟪 ROLE 3 — Hybrid
Core identity: Flexible robot that mixes behaviors
This robot can behave like a hopper, feeder, or shooter depending on:
•	Path choice
•	Collection rates
•	Travel times
•	Cycle size preference
Typical traits
•	Balanced stats
•	Medium or large capacity
•	Good accuracy
•	Moderate travel times
•	Can operate in center or wing
Strategic purpose
•	Adapt to congestion
•	Fill gaps in alliance composition
•	Provide redundancy

🟥 ROLE 4 — Defender
Core identity: Robot that disrupts opponents
This robot focuses on reducing opponent scoring rather than maximizing its own.
Typical traits
•	High defend aggressiveness
•	Lower shooting or collection stats
•	Often stays in bump or scoring zones
•	Interferes with opponent travel and accuracy
Strategic purpose
•	Slow down opponent cycles
•	Increase opponent congestion
•	Protect your alliance’s scoring lanes

🧠 How These Roles Interact in the Simulation
The simulation evaluates alliances of three robots, each with:
•	A role
•	A path choice
•	Collection rates
•	Travel times
•	Shooting rates
•	Accuracy
•	Capacity
•	Cycle size preference
•	Defend aggressiveness
The GA evolves combinations that maximize Teleop scoring under:
•	Congestion
•	Opponent defender interference
•	Travel penalties
•	Accuracy penalties
•	Path differences
This leads to emergent strategies like:
•	One hopper + one shooter + one feeder
•	One hopper + one hybrid + one defender
•	One wing specialist + two center robots
•	One fast shooter + two large capacity robots
